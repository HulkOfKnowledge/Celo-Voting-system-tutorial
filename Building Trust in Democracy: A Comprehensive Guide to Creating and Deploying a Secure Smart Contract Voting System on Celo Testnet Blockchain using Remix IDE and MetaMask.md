## Introduction

The democratic process is the cornerstone of modern societies, and it is essential to ensure its fairness, transparency, and security. However, traditional voting systems are susceptible to fraud, hacking, and other forms of manipulation, leading to a loss of trust in the democratic process. Smart contract-based voting systems built on blockchain technology offer a promising solution to these challenges by providing a transparent and secure way of conducting elections.

In this tutorial, we will walk through the process of creating and deploying a secure smart contract voting system on Celo Testnet blockchain using remix IDE and MetaMask. Celo is a fast-growing blockchain platform that focuses on making decentralized finance (DeFi) accessible to everyone. Celo's robust infrastructure and user-friendly environment make it an ideal platform for building decentralized applications, including voting systems.

First, we will introduce you to the concept of smart contracts and blockchain technology. We will explain how smart contracts work and how they can be used to build secure and transparent voting systems. Then, we will dive into the Celo Testnet blockchain platform, which provides a sandbox environment for developers to test and deploy their smart contracts.

Next, we will guide you through the process of designing a smart contract-based voting system using Solidity, a programming language used for writing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. We will explain the key components of a voting system, including the voter registration process, ballot creation, and vote counting. We will also provide examples of smart contract code for each component, making it easy for you to follow along.

Once we have designed the smart contract voting system, we will move on to testing it on the Celo Testnet blockchain. Testing is a critical step in the development process as it ensures that the system works as intended and that there are no vulnerabilities that can be exploited by malicious actors.

Finally, we will guide you through the process of deploying the smart contract voting system on the Celo Testnet blockchain. We will explain the steps involved in deploying a smart contract and how to interact with it using a web-based interface.


By the end of this guide, you will have the skills and knowledge necessary to create and deploy a secure smart contract voting system on Celo Testnet blockchain. You will also be equipped with best practices for ensuring the security and transparency of your voting system, making it a trustworthy solution for conducting fair and transparent elections.

Understanding Smart Contract and Celo Testnet Blockchain
---
Before we delve into designing and deploying a secure smart contract voting system on Celo Testnet Blockchain, it is important to have a clear understanding of what smart contracts and Celo Testnet Blockchain are.

* Smart contracts are self-executing computer programs that automatically enforce the terms of a contract. These contracts are written in code and are deployed on a blockchain network. Once the conditions set out in the contract are met, the smart contract executes the predetermined actions without the need for intermediaries.

* Celo Testnet Blockchain, on the other hand, is a blockchain network designed specifically for mobile devices. It is built on top of the Ethereum blockchain and uses the same consensus algorithm as Ethereum, Proof of Work (PoW). However, Celo has implemented its own proof of stake consensus mechanism, which allows for faster and more cost-effective transactions.

    The Celo Testnet Blockchain provides a secure and decentralized environment for deploying smart contracts. It has a built-in wallet, which allows users to store and manage their digital assets, including Celo native tokens (CELO) and Celo Dollar stablecoin (cUSD). The Celo Testnet Blockchain also supports a variety of programming languages, including Solidity, which is the programming language used to develop Ethereum-based smart contracts.

In order to interact with the Celo Testnet Blockchain and deploy smart contracts, you will need to use a development environment such as Remix IDE and a wallet such as MetaMask.

* [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/) is a web-based integrated development environment for writing, testing, and deploying smart contracts on Ethereum-based blockchains, including Celo Testnet Blockchain. It provides a user-friendly interface for writing and compiling Solidity code, debugging and testing smart contracts, and deploying them on the blockchain.

* [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/), on the other hand, is a browser extension that allows you to interact with Ethereum-based blockchains, including Celo Testnet Blockchain. It acts as a wallet and allows you to manage your digital assets and sign transactions on the blockchain.




Designing the Smart Contract Voting System
---

To begin, the first step in designing the smart contract voting system is to identify the requirements of the voting process. This includes understanding the voting rules, the number of participants, and the type of votes that will be cast. Once these requirements are established, the design process can begin.

We will design a smart contract for a voting system using [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/), which can be accessed using this link: https://remix.ethereum.org/

![](https://i.imgur.com/XoQZUIm.png)


The smart contract which we will call **`VotingSystemAttempt`** will be responsible for managing the registration of voters, candidates, and conducting the election.
In order to create a smart contract in remix,follow the following steps:
1. click on the folder called `contracts`
2. just above the `contracts` folder is an icon labelled `create new file`,click on it
3. write the name of your contract and end with the `.sol` extension



Now, we are ready to start working on our contract.


### Variables and Structs
The smart contract voting system will consist of the following components:

1. *Chairperson*: The person who deploys the smart contract and is responsible for managing the election process.

2. *Voters*: Individuals who are eligible to vote in the election.

3. *Candidates*: Individuals who are running for election. Each candidate will have a party they belong to.

4. Elections: Each election will have a unique ID, an election type,an election stage(ie. registration,voting, end of election), a start and end time, and a list of eligible voters and candidates, total number of votes cast, total number of winning votes,address of the winner and party the winner belongs to.
    * We use the `enum` keyword to define the `ElectionType`,`ElectionStage` and `Party`
    
        *Enum is a user-defined data type that is used to define a set of named values. Each value in an enum is represented by a unique integer that starts at 0 for the first value and increments by 1 for each subsequent value. Enums are often used to represent options or states in a contract.*
        
###### For example, the following code defines an enum called ElectionType with four possible values:

```enum ElectionType {PRESIDENTIAL, GUBERNATORIAL, SENATE, HOUSE_OF_REPS}```

* *We use the `struct` keyword to define the three entities and their details valuable to this election: `Candidate`,`Voter` and `Election`*


    *`Struct` is another user-defined data type that is used to define a collection of variables of different types. Structs are often used to group related data together into a single object.*

###### For example, the following  code defines a struct called Candidate with three fields:
    struct Candidate {
        string name;
        address addr;
        Party party;
    }`

Our smart contract will also have the following functionalities:

* Election Registration: Before the election starts, the smart contract should allow the chairperson to set up an election by providing the election type and the duration of the election.

* Voter Registration: Only eligible voters can participate in the election. Therefore, we need to have a voter registration process where voters can register themselves by providing their name and Ethereum wallet address. The smart contract will maintain a list of eligible voters.

* Candidate Registration: Candidates should also register themselves for the election. Candidates should provide their name, Ethereum wallet address, and the political party they are representing. The smart contract will maintain a list of eligible candidates.



* Start Election: After the election has been set up, the smart contract will allow the chairperson to start the election.

* Vote Casting: Eligible voters can cast their vote by selecting the candidate they want to vote for. Once the vote has been cast, it will be recorded on the blockchain and will be immutable.

* End Election: After the election duration has elapsed, the smart contract will automatically end the election, and the winner will be declared.


Applying these concepts in solidity, we have the sample below:


```code=
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT

pragma solidity >=0.7.0 <0.9.0;

contract VotingSystemAttempt{

    enum ElectionType {PRESIDENTIAL, GUBERNATORIAL, SENATE, HOUSE_OF_REPS} //handles election type
    enum ElectionStage {START_REGISTRATION, START_ELECTION, END_ELECTION} //handles the different stages in the election
    enum Party {APV,PVP,LV,PDAPC,NONE} //handles the different parties allowed

    address chairPerson; // stores address of electoral chairman


    constructor(){
        chairPerson = msg.sender;
    }

    struct Candidate{
        string name; // candidate name
        address addr; // candidate address
        Party party; // candidate party
    }

    struct Voter{
        string name; // voter name
        address addr; // voter address
    }

    struct Election{
        uint electionID; // stores election id, which should be unique
        ElectionType electionType; // stores election type
        ElectionStage electionStage; // stores election stage
        address[] candidateAddress; // array of candidates by address
        uint[] candidateVotes; // array of candidate's vote that corresponds to candidate address
        address winner; // address of winner
        Party winnerParty; // party of winner
        uint totalVotes; // number of voters
        uint numOfWinningVotes; // number of votes for the winner
        uint256 startTime; // election start time
        uint256 endTime; // election end time
    }
```
###### DISCLAIMER: THE EXAMPLES USED IN THIS TUTORIAL ARE PURELY FICTIONAL AND HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH ANY POLITICAL PARTY OR PERSONNEL

### Mappings
Up next, we need to handle the following issues:
1.     Storing and accessing each voter's detail
1.     storing  and accessing each candidate's detail
1.     storing and accessing each election's details
1.     Keeping track of IDs used in previous elections
1.     Keeping track of eligible voters for a particular election
1.     Keeping track of eligible candidates for a particular election
1.     Keeping track of eligible voters who have voted already.

Inorder to handle the above issues, we employ the use of `mappings` in solidity.



###### In Solidity, mappings are a way to store key-value pairs, where the keys can be of any data type except mappings, and the values can be of any data type, including other mappings.

###### Mappings are useful for storing and retrieving data in an efficient manner. They are similar to hash tables or dictionaries in other programming languages.

###### Here is an example of how to define a mapping in Solidity:

`mapping (uint => string) public myMapping;`

###### In this example, we define a mapping called myMapping that maps uint keys to string values. The public keyword makes the mapping accessible from outside the contract. Mappings can also be used in more complex data structures. For example, here is a mapping that maps a uint ID to a struct representing a person:

`struct Person {
    string name;
    uint age;
}`

`mapping (uint => Person) public people;`

In this example, we define a mapping called `people` that maps `uint` keys to `Person` struct values. The `Person` struct contains a name field of type string and an age field of type uint.

Mappings can be declared as public, private, or internal and can also be nested within other mappings or data structures. It is important to note that mappings do not have a fixed length and can grow dynamically as data is added to them.

Applying this knowledge to our voting system,we obtain the following lines of code:

```code=
    // Mapping to check if an election ID has been used
    mapping(uint => bool) private usedIDs;

    // Mapping of voter details
    mapping (address=>Voter) voterDetails;

    // Mapping of candidate details
    mapping (address=>Candidate) candidateDetails;

    // Mapping of election details
    mapping (uint=>Election) electionDetails;

    // Mapping of eligible voters for each election
    mapping(uint => mapping(address => bool)) isEligibleVoter;

    // Mapping of eligible candidates for each election
    mapping(uint => mapping(address => bool)) isEligibleCandidate;

    // Mapping of voters who have already voted in an election
    mapping(uint => mapping (address=>bool)) hasVoted;
```

#### Explanation:

* `mapping(uint => bool) private usedIDs`: This mapping is used to keep track of which IDs have already been used in previous elections to ensure that no two elections have the same ID.

* `mapping (address=>Voter) voterDetails`: This mapping is used to store the details of each voter, where the voter's address is the key and the value is a Voter struct that contains the voter's name, age, and other relevant information.

* `mapping (address=>Candidate) candidateDetails`: This mapping is used to store the details of each candidate, where the candidate's address is the key and the value is a Candidate struct that contains the candidate's name, party affiliation, and other relevant information.*

* `mapping (uint=>Election) electionDetails`: This mapping is used to store the details of each election, where the election ID is the key and the value is an Election struct that contains information about the election, such as the start and end times and the list of candidates.

* `mapping(uint => mapping(address => bool)) isEligibleVoter`: This mapping is used to keep track of which voters are eligible to vote in each election, where the outer key is the election ID and the inner key is the voter's address.

* `mapping(uint => mapping(address => bool)) isEligibleCandidate`: This mapping is used to keep track of which candidates are eligible to run in each election, where the outer key is the election ID and the inner key is the candidate's address.

* `mapping(uint => mapping (address=>bool)) hasVoted`: This mapping is used to keep track of which voters have already cast their vote in each election, where the outer key is the election ID and the inner key is the voter's address.


### Modifiers

In Solidity, modifiers are special functions that can be used to modify the behavior of other functions. They are typically used to add additional requirements or conditions that must be met before a function can be executed.

Modifiers are defined using the `modifier` keyword and are usually placed before the function definition. When a function is called, Solidity checks if any modifiers have been applied to it. If there are any, Solidity will execute the modifier code before executing the function code. If the modifier code completes successfully, the function code will be executed. Otherwise, the function code will be skipped.

Here is an example of a modifier:

```code!
modifier onlyOwner {
    require(msg.sender == owner);
    _;
}
```

In this example, onlyOwner is the name of the modifier. It contains a require statement that checks if the sender of the transaction is the owner of the contract. If the sender is not the owner, the modifier will throw an exception and the function code will not be executed. If the sender is the owner, the _ symbol indicates where the function code should be executed.

Modifiers can be used to add other conditions as well, such as checking if a certain value has been reached, or if a certain time period has passed. By using modifiers, developers can add additional security and validation to their contracts, making them more robust and reliable.

For Our Voting System , we will employ the following the modifiers:

```code=
    // Modifier to check if the caller is the Chairperson
    modifier chairpersonOnly(){
        require(msg.sender==chairPerson,"ACCESS DENIED: Only the ChairPerson can call this fuction");
        _;
    }

    // Modifier to check if a voter is eligible to vote in an election
    modifier eligibleVoter(uint id,address addr){
        require(isEligibleVoter[id][addr],"ACTION DENIED: Only eligible voters are permitted ");
        _;
    }
    
    // Modifier to check if a candidate is eligible to participate in an election
    modifier eligibleCandidate(uint id,address addr){
        require(isEligibleCandidate[id][addr],"ACTION DENIED: Only eligible candidates are permitted ");
        _;
    }

    // Modifier to check if an election has started
    modifier startedElection(uint _electionID){
        require(
            electionDetails[_electionID].electionStage == ElectionStage.START_ELECTION,
             "ERROR: Election has not started"
              );

        require(electionDetails[_electionID].startTime>0,"ERROR: Election has not started");
        _;
    }

    // This modifier checks if the current time is before the election end time.
    // It only allows the function to be executed if the current time is before the election end time.
    modifier  beforeDeadline(uint _electionID){
        require(block.timestamp < electionDetails[_electionID].endTime, "Election Has Ended");
        _;
    }
```
#### Explanation:
* `chairpersonOnly`: This modifier checks whether the caller of the function is the ChairPerson or not. If the caller is not the ChairPerson, then the function call is rejected with an error message.

* `eligibleVoter`: This modifier checks whether the given address is an eligible voter for a specific election. If the address is not an eligible voter, then the function call is rejected with an error message.

* `eligibleCandidate`: This modifier checks whether the given address is an eligible candidate for a specific election. If the address is not an eligible candidate, then the function call is rejected with an error message.

* `startedElection`: This modifier checks whether the given election has started or not. If the election has not started yet, then the function call is rejected with an error message.

* `beforeDeadline`: This modifier checks whether the current time is before the election deadline or not. If the current time is after the deadline, then the function call is rejected with an error message

### Events
Events are a way for contracts to communicate that something has happened on the blockchain. Events are defined using the `event` keyword followed by the name of the event and its parameters (if any).

```code! 
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract MyContract {
  event NewPersonAdded(string name, uint age);
  
  function addPerson(string memory _name, uint _age) public {
    // add person to the contract
    emit NewPersonAdded(_name, _age); // emit the event
  }
}
```
In this example, we've defined an `event` called NewPersonAdded with two parameters: name of type string and age of type uint. Whenever a new person is added to the contract using the addPerson function, the NewPersonAdded event is `emitted` with the person's name and age as parameters.

Events are useful for notifying external applications of changes that occur within a contract. For example, a web application can listen for events emitted by a contract and update its user interface accordingly. Events are also used for debugging and auditing purposes, as they provide a permanent record of all state changes that occur within a contract.

In the case of our voting system attempt,we will define the following events:

```code=
// Event that is emitted when the registration for an election is open.
    event RegistrationOpen(uint _electionID);

    // Event that is emitted when a voter is successfully registered.
    event VoterRegistered(string _name,address _addr);

    // Event that is emitted when a candidate is successfully registered.
    event CandidateRegistered(string _name, address _addr, Party _party);

    // Event that is emitted when the registration for an election is closed.
    event RegistrationClosed(uint _electionID, ElectionType _electionType);

    // Event that is emitted when an election is started.
    event StartElection(uint _electionID, ElectionType _electionType);

    // Event that is emitted when an election is ended.
    event EndElection(uint _electionID, ElectionType _electionType);

    // Event that is emitted when the result of a candidate is logged.
    event LogCandidateResult(string candidateName, address candidateAddress,Party candidateParty,uint votes);
```

#### Explanation:
* `RegistrationOpen`: This event is emitted when registration for an election opens. It takes one parameter, _electionID, which is the ID of the election for which registration has been opened.

* `VoterRegistered`: This event is emitted when a new voter is registered for an election. It takes two parameters, _name and _addr, which are the name and address of the voter, respectively.

* `CandidateRegistered`: This event is emitted when a new candidate is registered for an election. It takes three parameters, _name, _addr, and _party, which are the name, address, and party of the candidate, respectively.

* `RegistrationClosed`: This event is emitted when registration for an election is closed. It takes two parameters, _electionID and _electionType, which are the ID and type of the election for which registration has been closed.

* `StartElection`: This event is emitted when an election starts. It takes two parameters, _electionID and _electionType, which are the ID and type of the election that has started.

* `EndElection`: This event is emitted when an election ends. It takes two parameters, _electionID and _electionType, which are the ID and type of the election that has ended.

* `LogCandidateResult`: This event is emitted when the result of an election is announced. It takes four parameters, candidateName, candidateAddress, candidateParty, and votes, which are the name, address, party, and number of votes of the candidate, respectively.


### Functions
First we will work on the `allowElectionRegistration` function

```code=
    // Allows the chairperson to open registration for a new election, and emits a RegistrationOpen event.
    function allowElectionRegistration(
        uint _electionID
    )
    public chairpersonOnly{
         // Require that the election ID has not already been used.
        require(!usedIDs[_electionID], "ERROR: Election ID already exists");
        
        // Require that the election has not started yet.
        require(!(electionDetails[_electionID].startTime > 0), "ERROR: Election has started already");
        
        // Set the used IDs mapping to true for this election.
        usedIDs[_electionID] = true;
        // Set the election stage to start registration.
        electionDetails[_electionID].electionStage = ElectionStage.START_REGISTRATION;
        
        // Emit a RegistrationOpen event.
        emit RegistrationOpen(_electionID);
    }

```

###### Explanation:
###### This function allows the ChairPerson to open the registration process for a new election by changing the election stage to START_REGISTRATION.
###### 
###### The function takes a single argument _electionID which is the unique ID of the election that needs to be registered.
###### 
###### The first require statement checks that the provided election ID does not already exist. If the ID already exists, it throws an error.
###### 
###### The second require statement checks that the start time of the election has not already been set. If the start time has already been set, it means the election has already started and the registration cannot be opened.
###### 
###### If both the conditions are satisfied, the function updates the usedIDs mapping to mark the _electionID as used and sets the electionStage to START_REGISTRATION. It then emits the RegistrationOpen event with the _electionID as the argument to indicate that the registration process has been opened for the specified election.

Next, we will work on the `registerVoter` function.
```code=
    // Function to register a voter for an election.
    // This function can only be called by the chairperson of the election.
    function registerVoter(
        uint _electionID,
        string memory name,
        address addr
    )
    public chairpersonOnly {
       // Check if the election ID is valid.
        require(usedIDs[_electionID], "ERROR: Election ID does not exist");

        // Check if the registration is open.
        require(
            electionDetails[_electionID].electionStage == ElectionStage.START_REGISTRATION,
            "ERROR: Registration is not Open"
            );

        // Check if the voter has already been registered.
        require(isEligibleVoter[_electionID][addr]==false,"ERROR: Voter has already been registered");

        // Register the voter.
        voterDetails[addr] = Voter(name,addr);
        isEligibleVoter[_electionID][addr] = true;

        // Emit the voter registration event.
        emit VoterRegistered(name, addr);
    }
```
###### The function takes in three parameters: _electionID, name, and addr.
###### The function can only be called by the chairperson as specified by the chairpersonOnly modifier.
###### The function first checks whether the _electionID exists and whether the registration stage for that election is open. If not, it throws an error and the function stops.
###### The function then checks whether the provided addr is already registered as a voter for that election. If it is, it throws an error and the function stops.
###### If the checks pass, the function adds the new voter to the isEligibleVoter mapping and sets the Voter struct for the provided addr. It then emits the VoterRegistered event with the provided name and addr.

Next, we will work on the `registerCandidate` function

```code=
    // Function to register a candidate for an election.
    // This function can only be called by the chairperson of the election.
    function registerCandidate(
        uint _electionID,
        string memory _name,
        address addr,
        Party _party
    )
    public chairpersonOnly{
        // Check if the election ID is valid.
        require(usedIDs[_electionID], "ERROR: Election ID does not exist");

        // Check if the registration is open.
        require(
            electionDetails[_electionID].electionStage == ElectionStage.START_REGISTRATION,
            "ERROR: Registration is not Open"
            );

        // Check if the candidate has already been registered.
        require(isEligibleCandidate[_electionID][addr]==false,"ERROR: Candidate has already been registered");

        // Register the candidate.
        candidateDetails[addr]= Candidate(_name,addr,_party);
        electionDetails[_electionID].candidateAddress.push(addr);
        electionDetails[_electionID].candidateVotes.push(0);

        isEligibleCandidate[_electionID][addr]=true;

        // Emit the candidate registration event.
        emit CandidateRegistered(_name, addr, _party);

    }
```

###### Explanation:
###### Here is a breakdown of what the function does:
###### 
###### The function takes in four parameters: the ID of the election, the name of the candidate, the address of the candidate, and the political party the candidate is affiliated with.
###### The function is public, meaning it can be called from outside the contract.
###### The function is only executable by the chairperson, as indicated by the chairpersonOnly modifier.
###### The function checks if the election ID exists and if the election is in the correct stage for candidate registration.
###### The function checks if the candidate has already been registered for the election.
###### The function creates a new Candidate struct and assigns it to the candidateDetails mapping using the candidate's address as the key.
###### The function adds the candidate's address to the candidateAddress array and sets the candidate's initial vote count to 0 in the electionDetails mapping for the given election ID.
###### The function sets the candidate's eligibility for the given election to true in the isEligibleCandidate mapping.
###### The function emits a CandidateRegistered event with the candidate's name, address, and party.


After registration of candidates and voters, the next function is to `initiateElectionData`. Here, we initialize the requirements of the election.
```code=
 // Allows the chairperson to initiate an election, and set its duration and type.
    function initiateElectionData(
        uint _electionID,
        ElectionType _electionType,
        uint _duration 
    )
    public chairpersonOnly{
       // Require that the election ID has already been used.
        require(usedIDs[_electionID], "ERROR: Election ID does not exist");

###### Explanation:
######  It takes in three arguments:
###### 
###### _electionID: an unsigned integer representing the unique ID of the election to be initiated.
###### _electionType: an enumerated type variable representing the type of election to be initiated.
###### _duration: an unsigned integer representing the duration of the election in seconds.
###### The function can only be called by the chairperson, as it has the chairpersonOnly modifier. The function first checks whether the election ID exists and is in the START_REGISTRATION stage. It also checks that there are at least two candidates registered for the election.
###### 
###### If all requirements are met, the function updates the usedIDs mapping to mark the election ID as used. It then populates the electionDetails mapping for the given election ID with various election data, including the election type, winner address and party, total votes, start and end times, and election stage.
###### 
###### Once the election data is successfully initiated, the election stage is updated to START_ELECTION.


Time to work on the all important function; the `vote` function.
```code=
    // Allows a voter to cast a vote for a candidate in an election.
    function vote(
        uint _electionID,
        address candidateAddr
    )
    public
    startedElection(_electionID) beforeDeadline(_electionID)
    eligibleVoter(_electionID,msg.sender) eligibleCandidate(_electionID,candidateAddr)
    {
        // Require that the voter has not already voted.
        require(!hasVoted[_electionID][msg.sender], "ERROR: You have voted already!");
        
        // Find the index of the candidate in the candidate address array.
        (bool candidateFound, int candidateIndex) = 
        findCandidateIndex(electionDetails[_electionID],candidateAddr);
       
        // Require that the candidate was found.
        require(candidateFound, "ERROR: Candidate not found in election");
        
        // Increment the candidate's vote count and the total vote count for the election.
        electionDetails[_electionID].candidateVotes[uint(candidateIndex)]++;
        electionDetails[_electionID].totalVotes++;
        
        // Set the hasVoted mapping to true for this voter and election.
        hasVoted[_electionID][msg.sender] = true;
    }

```

###### Explanation:
######  It is a public function that allows a registered voter to cast their vote for a candidate in a specific election.
###### 
###### The function takes two parameters: _electionID and candidateAddr. _electionID is the ID of the election in which the voter wants to vote, and candidateAddr is the address of the candidate the voter wants to vote for.
###### 
###### There are four modifiers applied to this function:
###### 
* ###### `startedElection(_electionID)`: This modifier ensures that the election with the given _electionID has started before allowing the voter to cast their vote.
###### 
* ###### `beforeDeadline`(_electionID): This modifier ensures that the current time is before the deadline for the given _electionID.
###### 
* ###### `eligibleVoter(_electionID,msg.sender)`: This modifier ensures that the voter trying to cast their vote is registered and eligible to vote in the given _electionID.
###### 
* ###### `eligibleCandidate(_electionID,candidateAddr)`: This modifier ensures that the candidate being voted for is registered and eligible to run in the given _electionID.
###### 
###### If all the modifiers pass, the function checks if the voter has already cast their vote for the given _electionID. If the voter has not yet cast their vote, the function then searches for the index of the candidate in the candidate list of the given _electionID. If the candidate is found, their vote count is incremented by 1 and the total vote count for the given _electionID is also incremented by 1. Finally, the function sets the hasVoted mapping for the given _electionID and the current voter to true, indicating that the voter has already cast their vote.


Another important functionality to be implemented is the `endElection` 
```code=
    // Asserts the official end of an election,can only be called by the chairperson
    function endElection(uint _electionID)
    public chairpersonOnly{
    
        // check if election ID exists
        require(usedIDs[_electionID], "ERROR: Election ID does not exist");
        
        // check if current time is after the election deadline
        require(
            block.timestamp >= electionDetails[_electionID].endTime,
            "ERROR: Election Deadline has not been met!"
            );
        
        // set the election stage to end the election
        electionDetails[_electionID].electionStage = ElectionStage.END_ELECTION;
    }
```

###### Explanation:
###### This function `endElection` is used to mark the end of the election period. It takes one input parameter _electionID which is the ID of the election to be ended.
###### 
###### The function starts by checking if the given _electionID exists in the usedIDs mapping, which is used to keep track of used IDs. If the ID does not exist, the function throws an error.
###### 
###### Then, it checks if the current time (block.timestamp) is greater than or equal to the election end time (electionDetails[_electionID].endTime). If the current time is less than the election end time, the function throws an error because the election deadline has not been met.
###### 
###### If the above conditions are met, the function updates the electionStage variable in the electionDetails mapping for the given _electionID to ElectionStage.END_ELECTION, which indicates that the election has ended.
###### 
###### Note that this function does not calculate or declare the election results. It only marks the end of the election period. The winner is calculated in a separate function.

Displaying the results at the end of the election naturally follows suit.

```code=
    //display election results
    function displayResults(uint _electionID) public  chairpersonOnly {
    // check if election ID exists
    require(usedIDs[_electionID], "ERROR: Election ID does not exist");
    
    // check if the election has ended
    require(
        electionDetails[_electionID].electionStage == ElectionStage.END_ELECTION,
         "ERROR: Election has not ended"
         );
    
    uint numCandidates = electionDetails[_electionID].candidateAddress.length;
    uint[] memory votes = new uint[](numCandidates);

    // sort candidates in descending order of votes
    for (uint i = 0; i < numCandidates - 1; i++) {
        for (uint j = i + 1; j < numCandidates; j++) {
            if (votes[i] < votes[j]) {
                (votes[i], votes[j]) = (votes[j], votes[i]);
                (electionDetails[_electionID].candidateAddress[i],
                 electionDetails[_electionID].candidateAddress[j])
                  = 
                (electionDetails[_electionID].candidateAddress[j],
                 electionDetails[_electionID].candidateAddress[i]);
            }
        }
    }

    // display sorted candidates
    for (uint i = 0; i < numCandidates; i++) {
        address candidateAddress = electionDetails[_electionID].candidateAddress[i];
        uint candidateVotes = electionDetails[_electionID].candidateVotes[i];
        string memory candidateName = candidateDetails[candidateAddress].name;
        Party candidateParty = candidateDetails[candidateAddress].party;
        emit LogCandidateResult(candidateName, candidateAddress, candidateParty, candidateVotes);
    }
}
```
###### Explanation
###### It displays the results of an election with the given _electionID. It first checks that the election ID exists and that the election has ended. It then creates a new dynamic array votes with length equal to the number of candidates in the election.
###### 
###### Next, it uses a sorting algorithm to sort the candidates in descending order of votes received. The algorithm iterates over all pairs of candidates and swaps their positions if the candidate at position i has fewer votes than the candidate at position j. At the end of this sorting process, the candidates will be ordered by the number of votes they received.
###### 
###### Finally, the function iterates over the sorted candidates and emits a LogCandidateResult event for each candidate, displaying their name, address, party affiliation, and the number of votes they received. This allows anyone to see the final results of the election.

## Deploying the Smart Contract Voting System on Celo Testnet Blockchain
---

To compile and deploy a smart contract on Remix IDE using its Virtual Machine, you need to follow these steps:

1. Compile the code: In the "Solidity Compiler" tab, select the appropriate compiler version (any version >=0.7.0 but <0.9.0) and click "Compile" to compile your code.

1. Deploy the contract: In the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab, select the appropriate environment (e.g., JavaScript VM, or Custom RPC), and click "Deploy" to deploy your contract.

3. Interact with the contract: Once your contract is deployed, you can interact with it by calling its functions in the "Deployed Contracts" section on the right-hand side panel.

To deploy using the celo Testnet and metamask, follow the steps below:

1. Open the MetaMask extension in your browser and click on your account avatar at the top right corner.

1. From the dropdown menu, click on "Settings".

1. In the Settings page, scroll down and click on "Networks".

1. Click on "Add Network" at the bottom of the networks list.

1. Enter the following details for the new network:

    *     Network Name: Celo Alfajores Testnet
    *     New RPC URL: https://alfajores-forno.celo-testnet.org
    *     Chain ID: 44787
    *     Symbol: CELO
    *     Block Explorer URL: https://alfajores-blockscout.celo-testnet.org/

1. Click "Save" to add the network to MetaMask.

1. You should now see the Celo Alfajores Testnet option in the network dropdown at the top of your MetaMask extension. Select it to switch to the Alfajores Testnet network.

1. With your metamask on the Celo testnet, go back to remix Ide,complie and deploy using `Injected Provider-metamask`
    ###### You might need some test funds to cover the gas fee of deployment. You can use the Celo Alfajores faucet to get some testnet funds for your Celo wallet. Here's the link to the faucet: https://faucet.celo.org/alfajores   .Copy your Celo Alfajores Testnet address from metamask and paste in the field `Account Address`.Check Metamask and you should see 1CELO has been sent to your wallet.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, building trust in democracy is crucial for a functioning society, and a secure smart contract voting system can be an effective solution. This comprehensive guide has provided step-by-step instructions for creating and deploying a secure smart contract voting system on the Celo Testnet Blockchain using Remix IDE and MetaMask. The included smart contract defines the necessary data structures and functions to facilitate the election process, including voter and candidate registration, election initiation, vote counting, and winner determination.

By implementing the features outlined in this guide, election administrators can ensure that only eligible voters and candidates participate in the election, and that the election is transparent and tamper-proof. Additionally, the smart contract's immutability ensures that the results of the election cannot be altered after the fact, further increasing trust in the election process.

It is important to note that while the system presented in this guide can be effective, it is not a perfect solution. Potential vulnerabilities and attack vectors should always be considered and mitigated to the best of one's ability. Furthermore, while the Celo Testnet is a suitable platform for testing and experimentation, deploying a real-world smart contract voting system on a public blockchain requires careful consideration and expertise.

Overall, building trust in democracy is a complex and ongoing endeavor, but a secure smart contract voting system is a powerful tool that can help facilitate fair and transparent elections.
